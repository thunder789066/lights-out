/**
 * Implements a new LightGrid object for the game. A LightGrid
 * is a specialized 2D grid of Lights (JButtons). The LightGrid's
 * responsibilities are to instantiate each Light with a starting
 * state, organize them into a GridLayout, and once a Light has
 * been clicked determine which of the Lights it was.
 * <p>
 * Once the Light that was clicked is found, the LightGrid should
 * handle finding all adjacent Lights and toggling each of them
 * on/off, and count the number of lights that are still on each
 * turn.
 * <p>
 * LightGrid extends a JPanel in order to implement all of the
 * properties of a simple container object including the Layout
 * features so a GridLayout can be created to organize the Lights.
